      <h1> Description</h1>
      <p>   Guess what? CNN Money has named this occupation as the best job in America.6 So it's probably a smart idea to look into the field of mobile app development, even if you have a felony on your record. The technology sector is filled with a lot of open-minded employers. And since demand is so high and many companies are having a hard time filling open positions for mobile application developers, you may be able to find some great opportunities if you can show that you have the necessary skills. Plus, doesn't making apps for iOS or Android devices sound like a lot of fun?
